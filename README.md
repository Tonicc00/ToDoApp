This project I made on my own. I understand it is not a big deal but I just wanted to start with the basics. 
It took me around two hours to finish it.
Also, when I say 'on my own' I mean without tutorials but just with the help of Google. 

I used useState hook for state management and bootstrap for styles. It is responsive (at least I hope so) and I tried to use proper tags. 
I had a little trouble trying to implement useState and make the app delete selected item on list instead all the items but it was just the matter of id.
In the future I hope these hooks will become natural to understand to me. For the help I used beta react documentation (https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) which was really helpful and I think I will use it in the future also.

The purpose of this app is obviously to make a list of things you need/would like to do and there is also a delete option.
